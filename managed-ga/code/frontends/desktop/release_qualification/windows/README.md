# Windows Desktop release qualification

This folder contains the Windows qualification runner for the portable desktop package. It exercises:

1. Download a GitHub Actions artifact, or use a local zip.
2. Verify commit, SHA-256, and required package files.
3. Extract to a clean directory.
4. Launch `GenericAgent.exe` directly.
5. Wait for first-run prepare, bridge identity, and bootstrap `ready`.
6. In `Full` mode, inject an unknown process on port `14168`, verify `port_conflict`, release it, and retry from setup.
7. Run the shared production-package qualification with the embedded Python: package-owned bridge plus
   external `GA_ROOT`, fake-model chat, upload, memory import, warm restart, a second foreign-port
   assertion, relocation into a path with spaces and Chinese characters, stale override fallback,
   optional P2P degradation, and process/settings cleanup.

## Full Run

```powershell
.\frontends\desktop\release_qualification\windows\Invoke-WindowsReleaseQualification.ps1 `
  -Repo abraxas914/GenericAgent `
  -RunId 29071095889 `
  -ExpectedCommit 696ddfc `
  -Mode Full
```

Use `-PackageZip C:\path\GenericAgent-Desktop-Windows-Portable.zip` when the artifact has expired or has already been downloaded.

## Modes

- `Smoke`: package verification, extraction, first launch, prepare marker, bridge identity, bootstrap ready.
- `FailureOnly`: assumes the package can be extracted and focuses on the unknown port conflict and setup retry path.
- `Full`: runs `Smoke`, the native retry failure path, and the complete production package qualification.
  It requires `-ExpectedCommit` so the bridge build identity is tied to the candidate SHA.

## Manual Checks

The script collects screenshots and writes these checklist items to the report for separate human review:

- Loading, prepare, setup, and main windows always show the Windows titlebar.
- Right side has exactly minimize, maximize, and close.
- Blank titlebar area drags the window; button area does not.
- Minimize works.
- Maximize and restore work.
- Close hides to tray instead of exiting.
- Sidebar nav sits directly below the custom titlebar with no blank row.
- The native directory picker opens and returns a real directory.
- The shortcut self-heals after the portable folder is moved.
- Loading, fallback, and main React pages render through the Tauri resource protocol.

Screenshot capture and checklist values are supporting evidence. They do not determine the automated
qualification result or need to be edited to `pass` before the evidence verifier runs.

## Report

Reports are written under `<WorkDir>\report`:

- `e2e-report.json`
- `bootstrap-events.jsonl`
- `bootstrap-latest.json`
- screenshots such as `loading-first.png`, `main-ready.png`, and `setup-failure.png`
- `production-contract/real-package-report.json`, including artifact SHA-256, OS/architecture,
  bootstrap phases, bridge identities, PIDs/ports, before/after paths, deterministic data results,
  and cleanup state

Failures exit non-zero and keep diagnostics unless `-KeepWorkDir` is omitted and cleanup succeeds.
