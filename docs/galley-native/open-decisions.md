# Galley Native Open Decisions

> Status: historical decision sheet. Slice 1 has shipped, the experimental
> Settings entry exists, and v0.3.0 now targets `galley_native` as the built-in
> default after dogfood gates.
>
> Scope: decisions that should be settled before Slice 1 implementation. This
> document does not implement code, schema, or runtime behavior.

## Purpose

This sheet records the early Slice 1 decisions that shaped `galley_native`.
Some entries are intentionally historical: they were correct before code
started, but later slices may have superseded their rollout wording.

Decision statuses:

- **Recommended**: current proposed direction.
- **Accepted**: ready to guide implementation.
- **Revisit**: do not implement until resolved.

## D1: Legacy `gaRuntimeKind` Projection

Status: Accepted and implemented.

Question: how should a native session appear in the existing
`schemaVersion: 1` fields?

Options:

| Option | Shape | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A. Mirror native | `runtimeKind = "galley_native"` and `gaRuntimeKind = "galley_native"` | Semantically ugly because `gaRuntimeKind` is GA-named |
| B. Keep GA-only | `runtimeKind = "galley_native"` and omit/null `gaRuntimeKind` for native | Higher v1 compatibility risk because the field is currently required |
| C. Schema v2 now | Rename/replace GA-shaped fields before native | Too much blast radius before Slice 1 |

Recommendation: **Option A for schema v1, with explicit deprecation debt**.

Why:

- `schemaVersion: 1` allows additive enum values but not removals/renames.
- Existing code and docs treat `gaRuntimeKind` as present on `SessionBrief`.
- Returning `null` or omitting it only for native would create a sharper client
  compatibility hazard than adding `galley_native`.
- `runtimeKind` remains the product-facing field; callers should prefer it.

Implementation notes:

- Add `galley_native` to the documented v1 enum set when Slice 1 lands.
- Add optional neutral fields only if implementation needs them, not as a v1
  rename workaround.
- Mark `gaRuntimeKind` as legacy compatibility projection in docs.
- Reserve the true cleanup for `schemaVersion: 2`.

User impact:

- Existing agents keep receiving a stable field.
- New agents can key on `runtimeKind` and ignore the GA-shaped legacy field.

## D2: Native Feature Gate

Status: Implemented / superseded by v0.3 default-switch direction.

Question: how is native enabled before the default-switch release?

Options:

| Option | Shape | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A. Environment flag | `GALLEY_NATIVE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` enables hidden native routes | Developer-only; not discoverable |
| B. Hidden pref | Internal DB preference toggled by CLI/debug command | More state to migrate and support |
| C. Visible Settings toggle | User-facing experimental runtime toggle | Too early; exposes unstable runtime |
| D. Compile feature | Build-time feature flag | Too rigid for dogfood binaries |

Original recommendation: **Option A for Slice 1-3; add a hidden pref only when
dogfood needs persistence**.

Current state:

- Slice 1 shipped the `GALLEY_NATIVE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` gate.
- The v0.3.0 default-switch implementation retires that gate for runtime
  filtering, session creation, native Goal proposals, and CLI `--runtime
  galley-native`.
- Settings -> Runtime now presents `galley_native` as the recommended built-in
  runtime and moves Python managed GA to an Advanced legacy fallback.
- The environment variable may remain as a no-op compatibility/test artifact,
  but it is no longer a product or API requirement.

Why:

- `galley_native` is no longer a peer beta hidden behind a developer switch; it
  is the built-in runtime path being prepared for v0.3.0.
- User risk is controlled by release gating, migration tests, and the Advanced
  managed fallback, not by a developer-only environment flag.
- External GA remains user-owned and is not migrated.

Implementation notes:

- Migration 024 promotes Galley-owned managed runtime metadata to
  `galley_native` while preserving external rows.
- Runtime listing and CLI arguments now accept `galley-native` without an
  environment variable.
- Release still requires dogfood/parity evidence before a public v0.3.0 build is
  promoted.

User impact:

- Built-in users land on the native runtime path by default in v0.3 development
  builds.
- If native blocks dogfood, the old Python managed GA path remains available as
  an Advanced fallback.

## D3: Mock-Model Provider Shape

Status: Recommended.

Question: should the mock model be a Core-internal test adapter or a persisted
Provider record?

Options:

| Option | Shape | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A. Core internal adapter | Mock responses live in tests/dev harness only | Not user-configurable |
| B. Fake Provider record | Mock appears in Provider/Model config | Pollutes product model |
| C. External test server | Mock model runs as local HTTP service | Extra moving part |

Recommendation: **Option A**.

Why:

- Mock model exists to make the loop deterministic, not to be a user runtime.
- It should not appear in onboarding, Settings, Provider lists, or persisted
  user model config.
- Tests can script exact tool calls, malformed responses, and recovery paths.

Implementation notes:

- Keep mock adapter behind test/dev-only module boundaries where practical.
- Use it for Slice 2, 4A, 5, 7, and parity harness tests.
- Do not let mock adapter shape leak into real provider abstractions.

User impact:

- No new setup concept.
- More deterministic native behavior before real users see it.

## D4: Native Memory Storage Shape

Status: Recommended.

Question: where should native memory and capability-pack state live?

Options:

| Option | Shape | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A. SQLite only | Store all memory/pack bodies in DB | Harder to inspect scripts/files; DB can bloat |
| B. Files only | Store memory as files under app data | Harder to query, diff, and rollback safely |
| C. Hybrid | SQLite metadata/evidence/index/change records + app-data resource files | More design work |

Recommendation: **Option C**.

Why:

- Memory needs identity, scope, evidence, diff, status, and rollback.
- Capability packs may include scripts and SOP bodies that are easier to handle
  as versioned resource files.
- Galley can expose `memory://` and `capability://` resources without making
  raw files the source of truth.

Implementation notes:

- SQLite owns metadata, indexes, evidence, change records, and activation.
- App-data resource files store larger SOP/script bodies with hashes and
  version references.
- Never use `managed-ga-state` as a native memory bridge.
- Never write external GA memory/SOP/skills.

User impact:

- Memory can be inspected and undone.
- Scripts remain file-like enough for review without becoming hidden mutable
  runtime code.

## D5: First Real Model Adapter

Status: Recommended.

Question: which real provider protocol should native support first?

Options:

| Option | Shape | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A. OpenAI-compatible first | Implement chat/tool-call compatible path first | Anthropic parity follows later |
| B. Anthropic-compatible first | Implement messages/tool-use path first | Smaller immediate coverage in current provider ecosystem |
| C. Both at once | Implement both before dogfood | Larger first adapter slice |

Recommendation: **Option A, while designing canonical messages to avoid
OpenAI lock-in**.

Why:

- Existing managed Provider/Model configuration already has broad
  OpenAI-compatible use.
- It is enough to prove one real native turn after the mock adapter.
- Anthropic-compatible support should follow, but not block Slice 3.

Implementation notes:

- Canonical `NativeMessage` / `ContentBlock` must remain provider-neutral.
- Tool-call parsing should keep Anthropic-style tool-use in mind.
- Adapter fixtures should include provider errors, max-token/incomplete, and
  structured tool-call responses.

User impact:

- First native dogfood can use the model setup Galley users already understand.
- Later provider parity does not require reworking the loop.

## D6: Runtime Event Ownership

Status: Recommended.

Question: should Slice 1 introduce a neutral runtime event model before native
emits real events?

Options:

| Option | Shape | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A. Keep Python `IpcEvent` as the shared model | Native fakes or reuses Python-shaped events | Leaks bridge semantics into native |
| B. Add internal `RuntimeEvent` and adapters | Python runner maps into neutral events; native emits neutral events | More initial plumbing |
| C. Redesign public event stream now | Public schema changes immediately | Too much v1 risk |

Recommendation: **Option B**.

Why:

- Native should not fake GA path, GA commit, or Python process metadata.
- GUI/CLI can keep compatible event projections while Core gains a neutral
  internal model.
- This makes Slice 2-4 easier to test without coupling to Python bridge names.

Implementation notes:

- `IpcEvent` remains the Python bridge input type.
- Add a Core-owned internal event representation with neutral `RuntimeReady`.
- Public streams keep v1 compatibility with optional additive fields.
- Do not remove Python-shaped public fields until a schema bump.

User impact:

- Existing session watching and GUI flows stay stable.
- Native can show truthful runtime state instead of placeholder GA metadata.

## Freeze Checklist

Before Slice 1 code starts:

- D1-D6 are accepted or explicitly revised.
- [Implementation Slices](./implementation-slices.md) still matches accepted
  decisions.
- [RFC 1](./rfc-1-runtime-boundary.md) and [RFC 7](./rfc-7-parity-harness-default-switch.md)
  reflect any decision changes that affect Slice 1.
- `managed` and `external` no-regression test expectations are listed in the
  Slice 1 implementation plan.
- Native is still hidden and cannot become the default.
